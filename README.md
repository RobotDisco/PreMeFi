#PreMeFi#
#### A MetaFilter reader for Palm's WebOS ####
---

### Abstract ###
**}** [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com). The eloquent zeitgeist. A site worth reading, a forum with participation. I would read this site on the bus, and I would feel great pleasure.

A news application, a low-hanging opportunity. A cheat, too; why stumble over parsing RSS when the canonical Mitch Allen [tutorial](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155261/) leads me by my fat babied fist?

A first WebOS application. Far from complete. My fear is not that you could improve upon it; that is almost certain. My fear is that you'll show me how much easier you could do so. ... But I have my ethics. I present this in GPL. 
**{**

### Requirements ###
The Palm Mojo SDK, available [here](http://developer.palm.com). While this should theoretically run on any version of WebOS, it was developed on version 1.4.5

One can install this software on either a real device or the virtual imagine included in the development kit.

### Installation ###
Two options:

1. Download from [source tree](http://www.github.com/thelambdacalculus/PreMeFi) and using `palm-package` from the SDK, generate an .ipk to install via `palm-install`. See SDK documentation for additional details. 
2. Alternatively, download pre-generated package [here] 

### Code Licenses ###
PreMefi falls under the second version of the GNU Public License.

PreMeFi makes heavy use of [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine-webos/), a unit testing and mocking framework. It falls under the MIT license.

### Author ###
PreMeFi is (currently) the sole construction of [The Lambda Calculus](http://www.thelambdacalculus.net).
