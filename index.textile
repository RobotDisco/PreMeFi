h3. Abstract

*}* "MetaFilter":http://www.metafilter.com. The eloquent zeitgeist. A site worth reading, a forum with participation. I would read this site on the bus, and I would feel great pleasure.

A news application, a low-hanging opportunity. A cheat, too; why stumble over parsing RSS when the canonical Mitch Allen "tutorial":http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155261 leads me by my fat babied fist?

A first WebOS application. Far from complete. My fear is not that you could improve upon it; that is almost certain. My fear is that you'll show me how much easier you could do so. ... But I have my ethics. I present this in GPL. 
*{*


h3. Requirements

The Palm Mojo SDK, available "here":http://developer.palm.com. While this should theoretically run on any version of WebOS, it was developed on version 1.4.5

One can install this software on either a real device or the virtual imagine included in the development kit.


h3. Installation

Two options:

1. Download from "source tree":http://www.github.com/thelambdacalculus/PreMeFi and using @palm-package@ from the SDK, generate an .ipk to install via @palm-install@. See SDK documentation for additional details. 
2. Alternatively, download pre-generated package [here] 


h3. Code Licenses

PreMefi falls under the second version of the GNU Public License.

PreMeFi makes heavy use of "Jasmine":http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine-webos/, a unit testing and mocking framework. It falls under the MIT license.


h3. Author

PreMeFi is (currently) the sole construction of "The Lambda Calculus":http://www.thelambdacalculus.net.


h3. Additional

Progress can be tracked via "Pivotal Tracker":https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/96950.
